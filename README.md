# ncnn

This is a fork of the ncnn library.
To see the latest changes, go [here](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn).
I created this fork in order to use an older release (tag `20200226`) because the android binary was under 3MB in size. While trying to build from that tag, I faced issues which I fix in this repo.
